# Basic Website Starter

A modern vanilla HTML/CSS/JS website

## About

This repository contains all of the files needed to begin a basic static HTML website build (aka “JAMstack”).

In this repository you'll find all of the files needed for a basic HTML website:

1. [index.html](index.html) contains all of the HTML code
2. [styles.css](styles.css) contains all of the CSS styles
3. [scripts.js](scripts.js) contains all of the JavaScript code

It also includes two icons, [favicon.ico](favicon.ico) and [apple-touch-icon.png](apple-touch-icon.png) which, as long as they're named these particular names and present in the root folder of your website will be found and used automatically - no need for adding anything to our HTML as long as these two files are present.</p>
