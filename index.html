<h1>Basic Website Starter</h1>

<p>In this folder you'll find all of the files needed for a basic HTML website:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href=#>index.html</a> (this file) contains all of the HTML code
  <li><a href=styles.css title="View the CSS stylesheet">styles.css</a> contains all of the CSS styles
  <li><a href=scripts.js title="View the JavaScript module">scripts.js</a> contains all of the JavaScript code
</ol>

<p>It also includes two icons, <a href=favicon.ico title="View the favicon">favicon.ico</a> and <a href=apple-touch-icon.png title="View the touch icon">apple-touch-icon.png</a> which, as long as they're named these particular names and present in the root folder of your website will be found and used automatically - no need for adding anything to our HTML as long as these two files are present.</p>
